    <h1>This  is External CSS style</h1>
    <p>External CSS is used to place CSS code in a separate file and link to the HTML document. To use external CSS, create a separate file with the .css file extension that contains your CSS rules. You can link this file to your HTML document using the “link” tag in the head section of your HTML document. </p>
